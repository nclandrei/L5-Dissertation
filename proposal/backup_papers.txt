DATA QUALITY

\textbf{Software Process Data Quality and Characteristics}\cite{bachmann2009software}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What were the goals?}
    The authors are trying to investigate different software process data
    (e.g. bug tracking databases, version control systems logs) in order to
    infer quality and characteristics. Then, they want to compute measures
    and discuss the issues that arise from these observations.
  \item \textbf{What was the method?}
    They examined 6 software projects, 5 of which were open source, by extracting
    the SVN and CVS logs, as well as the content of the bug tracker databases. Then,
    they tried to link the logs with the contents of the bug tracker databases as they
    are not integrated by default. 
  \item \textbf{What did they learn?}
    Firstly, the closed source project the authors examined showed much more data
    quality as the open source counterparts, among which better average attachments 
    per bug report, better average status changes per bug report or average commits
    per bug report/developer. Moreover, the authors found that there is little linkage
    between bug reports and version control logs, thus reducing the overall traceability.
    Also, there is reduced quality in change logs as, for example, the Eclipse project
    has more than 20\% empty commit messages. In conclusion, closed source projects will
    probably exhibit improved data quality than open source ones, but data quality in general
    differs from project to project.
  \item \textbf{Relevance to our work}:
    The analysis on data quality in open/closed source projects presented in this 
    research is valuable to us as it presents various statistics on commits, bug report
    structure and quality, as well as linkage between the two. We might apply the techniques
    in our own research on ticket quality.

\textbf{Data Quality in Context}\cite{strong1997data}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What were the goals?}
    The main goal of the authors was to analyze data quality in different 
    organizations, observe data quality problem patterns as well as see 
    its implications.
  \item \textbf{What was the method?}
    They performed a qualitative analysis, examining 42 data quality projects 
    from 3 organizations. They collected data via interviews of data procedures,
    custodians, customers and managers. The authors analysed each project using
    the data quality dimensions as content analysis codes. 
  \item \textbf{What did they learn?}
    One thing that the authors learned is that representational data quality 
    dimensions are underlying causes of accessibility data quality problem 
    patterns. Also, they observed three underlying causes for users' complaints
    regarding data not supporting their tasks:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item incomplete data;
        \item inadequately defined or measured data;
        \item data that could not be appropriately aggregated.
      \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Relevance to our work}: this paper brings valuable insight into
    major data quality issues and patterns, information which we can apply in 
    our own research.
\end{itemize}
