DATA QUALITY

\textbf{Software Process Data Quality and Characteristics}\cite{bachmann2009software}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What were the goals?}
    The authors are trying to investigate different software process data
    (e.g. bug tracking databases, version control systems logs) in order to
    infer quality and characteristics. Then, they want to compute measures
    and discuss the issues that arise from these observations.
  \item \textbf{What was the method?}
    They examined 6 software projects, 5 of which were open source, by extracting
    the SVN and CVS logs, as well as the content of the bug tracker databases. Then,
    they tried to link the logs with the contents of the bug tracker databases as they
    are not integrated by default. 
  \item \textbf{What did they learn?}
    Firstly, the closed source project the authors examined showed much more data
    quality as the open source counterparts, among which better average attachments 
    per bug report, better average status changes per bug report or average commits
    per bug report/developer. Moreover, the authors found that there is little linkage
    between bug reports and version control logs, thus reducing the overall traceability.
    Also, there is reduced quality in change logs as, for example, the Eclipse project
    has more than 20\% empty commit messages. In conclusion, closed source projects will
    probably exhibit improved data quality than open source ones, but data quality in general
    differs from project to project.
  \item \textbf{Relevance to our work}:
    The analysis on data quality in open/closed source projects presented in this 
    research is valuable to us as it presents various statistics on commits, bug report
    structure and quality, as well as linkage between the two. We might apply the techniques
    in our own research on ticket quality.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Quality in Context}\cite{strong1997data}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What were the goals?}
    The main goal of the authors was to analyze data quality in different 
    organizations, observe data quality problem patterns as well as see 
    its implications.
  \item \textbf{What was the method?}
    They performed a qualitative analysis, examining 42 data quality projects 
    from 3 organizations. They collected data via interviews of data procedures,
    custodians, customers and managers. The authors analysed each project using
    the data quality dimensions as content analysis codes. 
  \item \textbf{What did they learn?}
    One thing that the authors learned is that representational data quality 
    dimensions are underlying causes of accessibility data quality problem 
    patterns. Also, they observed three underlying causes for users' complaints
    regarding data not supporting their tasks:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item incomplete data;
        \item inadequately defined or measured data;
        \item data that could not be appropriately aggregated.
      \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Relevance to our work}: this paper brings valuable insight into
    major data quality issues and patterns, information which we can apply in 
    our own research.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Quality Assessment}\cite{pipino2002data}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What were the goals?}
    The main goal of the authors is to present ways of developing usable data
    quality metrics that organizations can implement in their own internal 
    processes.
  \item \textbf{What was the method?}
    They have researched previous methods of assessing data quality in information
    systems and they formulated general advice that can be directly implemented
    by organizations in their processes.
  \item \textbf{What did they learn?}
    They learned that there is no universal approach to assessing data quality
    as it heavily depends on the context where it is analysed.
  \item \textbf{Relevance to our work}: it shows how one can effectively measure
    data quality in information systems, thus we can apply it on the quality of
    the tickets we are analysing.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Product perspective on total Data Quality Assessment}\cite{wang1998product}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What were the goals?}
    The author wanted to create a Total Data Quality Management methodology so that
    high quality information products could be delivered to information consumers.
  \item \textbf{What was the method?}
    The research presents us, firstly, with a couple of definitions for the methodology:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item TDQM cycle - define, measure, analyze and improve information quality continuously;
        \item information product - information output from an information manufacturing system
          that has value to the information consumer;
        \item information quality - fitness for use by information consumers.
      \end{itemize}
    Then, the author presents the four steps in order to successfully implement the TDQM methodology:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item clearly articulate the information product;
        \item establish several roles that would be in charge of the information product management;
        \item teach information quality assessment and management skills to all IP constituencies;
        \item institutionalize continuous information product improvement.
      \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What did they learn?}
    The author learned that this methodology is filling a gap in the information quality
    world and that it could help organizations better manage the information quality of their
    information products.
  \item \textbf{Relevance to our work}
    This article could prove helpful to our own research as the methodology presented could help
    us in detecting if there is data quality in the projects we will be analyzing.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{AIMQ}\cite{lee2002aimq}:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{What were the goals?}
     The main challenge set by the authors was to develop an overall model
     with an accompanying assessment instrument for quantifying information
     quality.
   \item \textbf{What was the method?}
     They developed a methodology called AIM quality (hence the name AIMQ) which
     they applied at 5 different organizations. It has 3 main components:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 2 $\times$ 2 model of what information quality means to managers;
        \item questionnaire for measuring information quality along the dimensions
          found in first step;
        \item two analysis techniques for interpreting the assessments captured 
          by the questionnaire.
      \end{itemize} 
   \item \textbf{What did they learn?}
      They conclude that the AIMQ methodology proved to be a practical information
      quality tool to organizations.
   \item \textbf{Relevance to our work}: the paper gave us valuable insight into 
     how to assess information quality.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Metrics for Measuring Data Quality}\cite{Heinrich2007MetricsDataQuality}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What were the goals?}
    The authors of the paper aimed to answer the two main research questions:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item how can data quality be measured as metrics?
        \item what can be done in regards to data quality and what economic
          consequences would it bring?
      \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What was the method?}
    They applied the metric for timeliness at a major German mobile services
    provider. Due to some Data Quality issues the company was having, they had
    lower mailing campaign success rates, but after applying the metrics, the 
    company was able to establish a direct connection between the results of
    measuring data quality and the success rates of campaigns.
  \item \textbf{What did they learn?}
    For some practical problems, the metrics that they applied in regards to
    data quality proved to be quite appropriate. As they designed the metrics
    to revolve around interpretability and cardinality, they could quantify
    data quality, thus they could analyse the economical impact.
  \item \textbf{Relevance to our work}: this paper could possibly help us in
    measuring data quality. This is an important step in our research as we 
    specifically need to measure quality in software tickets.
\end{itemize
